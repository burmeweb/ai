The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. It includes smooth animations, transitions, and a modern design that provides an excellent user experience.

To run the application, you'll need to:

2. Set up a Cloudflare Workers account and update the configuration in `wrangler.toml`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Build the project with `npm run build`
5. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers with `npm run deploy`

```

The application is now ready for use and can be further customized and extended as needed.
